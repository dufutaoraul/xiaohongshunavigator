# leakless.exe Compatibility Issue on Windows 11 24H2 (Build 26100.6584)

## Environment
- **OS**: Windows 11 Home, Version 24H2 (Build 26100.6584)
- **Architecture**: x64
- **xiaohongshu-mcp version**: windows-amd64 (latest from releases)
- **Error Code**: 216

## Problem Description
When running both `xiaohongshu-login-windows-amd64.exe` and `xiaohongshu-mcp-windows-amd64.exe`, I consistently get the following error:

```
panic: fork/exec C:\Users\杜富陶\AppData\Local\Temp\leakless-amd64-adb80298fa6a3af7ced8b1c9b5f18007\leakless.exe: This version of %1 is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information and then contact the software publisher.
```

## What I've Tried
1. ✅ **File Integrity**: Re-downloaded and verified file sizes (14MB login tool, 18MB mcp service)
2. ✅ **Permissions**: Ran as administrator, unblocked files using `Unblock-File` PowerShell command
3. ✅ **SmartScreen**: Disabled Windows Defender SmartScreen warnings
4. ✅ **Chrome Path**: Tried specifying Chrome binary path with `-bin` parameter
5. ✅ **Cache Cleanup**: Cleared leakless temp directories
6. ✅ **Cookie File**: Created proper cookies.json with valid xiaohongshu cookies

## Technical Details
- **leakless.exe path**: `C:\Users\杜富陶\AppData\Local\Temp\leakless-amd64-adb80298fa6a3af7ced8b1c9b5f18007\leakless.exe`
- **Error occurs**: During browser initialization, before cookie loading
- **Service Status**: HTTP server starts successfully on :18060, but API calls fail due to leakless.exe issue

## Expected Behavior
The MCP service should be able to:
1. Initialize browser automation using leakless.exe
2. Load provided cookies.json
3. Successfully scrape xiaohongshu user profiles

## Current Workaround
None found. The service cannot function without leakless.exe working properly.

## System Information
```
Edition: Windows 11 Home
Version: 24H2
Build: 26100.6584
Architecture: x64
```

## Request
Could you please:
1. Update leakless.exe to be compatible with Windows 11 24H2?
2. Or provide instructions on how to manually replace leakless.exe with a compatible version?
3. Or suggest an alternative browser automation approach that doesn't rely on leakless.exe?

## Additional Context
This appears to be a known compatibility issue with the current leakless.exe binary bundled with the project. The error 216 specifically indicates that the executable is not compatible with the current Windows version.

Thank you for your excellent work on this project! Looking forward to your guidance.
